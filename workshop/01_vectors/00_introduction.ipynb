    "Traditionly, we use [GDAL](http://gdal.org) library for interacting with vector data. Lately, [Shapely](https://toblerity.org/shapely/index.html) library is becoming the popular too, as well as [Fiona](http://toblerity.org/fiona/manual.html) does.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop will focus on Fiona and OGR. [Fiona](http://toblerity.org/fiona/) is maitained by [Sean Gillies](https://github.com/sgillies). It is adding new layer on top of OGR, which is more compliant to what is common in Python. Compared to Fiona, with OGR more low-level data access can be achieved."
